# Who am I?
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a student from *Renmin Unversity of China*, named *Bingru Yan*. Though I majoy in Agricultural Economics, I'm interested in mathematics,python and machine learning. So, if you have similar interests, wellcome you concact me.
# What am I doing?
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This year is my last year as a undergraduate. I've prepared to stuty further in RUC, but unluckily, I failed in the entrance examiantion of graduate. So this year, I may spend my most time on preparing it.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, sometimes I do exercise on ***Analysis*** writen by Terence Tao. But I'm not good at mathematics, so I hope we can dicuss it. It must be better, if you can tell me mistake.
# Last but not least.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to test wheather Github show the formula.
$$AB^2+BC^2=AC^2$$
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's too bad!!!
